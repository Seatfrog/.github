# Welcome!

This Github organisation represents the ntirety of code that is running in production, if you have old code that isn't in use, or code that may be used in the future but is not in active development it should be moved to the [seatfrog-archive](https://github.com/seatfrog-archive) organisation.

## Housekeeping

* Keep your repos clean, avoid long lived branches, prefer [branch by abstraction](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/BranchByAbstraction.html).
* You MUST have a high quality README in your repo that follows [these documentation standards](https://www.notion.so/seatfrog/Technology-539ad17684404123884dde0781a74101).
* The full handbook for standards at Seatfrog can be found in the [Technology section in Notion](https://www.notion.so/seatfrog/Technology-539ad17684404123884dde0781a74101).

GLHF!
